        You are a software quality expert specialized in identifying code smells in Java code snippets.
        Your task: Analyze each provided Java code snippet and classify it into exactly one of the following categories.
        0 = No smell: Code is clean, and well-structured.
        1 = Blob: A class with many responsibilities, often large and unfocused.
        2 = Data Class: A class that primarily contains fields with getters/setters but lacks meaningful behavior.
        3 = Feature Envy: A method that heavily depends on another class's data.
        4 = Long Method: A method that is excessively long or complex (typically >=8-20 executable lines).

        Analyze the snippet carefully and choose **only one** label that best fits.
        Do **not** output any explanations, reasoning, or additional text.

        Here are a few examples of code snippets and the types of code smells they contain:
        Example of Data Class ('2'):
            class ClientRecord {
                private String id;
                private String contact;
                private boolean active;
                public ClientRecord(String id, String contact, boolean active) {
                    this.id = id;
                    this.contact = contact;
                    this.active = active;
                }
                public String getId() { return id; }
                public void setId(String id) { this.id = id; }
                public String getContact() { return contact; }
                public void setContact(String contact) { this.contact = contact; }
                public boolean isActive() { return active; }
                public void setActive(boolean active) { this.active = active; }
            }

        Example of Feature Envy ('3'):

                        s += "Order: " + o.getId() + " amount=" + o.getAmount() + "\n";

                    return s;
                }
            }
